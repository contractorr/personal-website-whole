def invest(starting_amount, cagr, num_years, beginning_year=0, annual_topup=0, topup_years=0):
    """Calculate and plot the value of an investment portfolio over time
    Args:
        starting_amount(float): the initial amount to be invested
        
        cagr(float): the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). This is the annual rate of growth an investment is expected to generate. If CAGR = 25 and starting_amount = 100, then after 1 year your nominal ROI will be 25% and the value of your portfolio will be 125. After 3 years your nominal ROI will be 95% and the value of your portfolio will be 195 (100*(1.25**3)). 
        
        num_years(int): the number of years you intend to invest
        
        beginning_year(int, optional): the tax year you intend to make the initial investment. If not input, then the next tax year will be used. E.g. if the current date is Dec 2020, tax year of April 2021 - April 2022 will be used.  
        
        annual_topup(float, optional): any additional funds to be added to the portfolio on an annual basis, at the start of each tax year. These will be added for topup_years. 
        
        topup_years(int, optional): the number of years after beginning_year that the annual_topup amount will be added to the portfolio. E.g. if beginning_year = 2021, annual_topup = 1000 and topup_years = 4, than (£)1000 will be added to the overall value of your portfolio at the start of 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025. 
    
    Returns:
        results: a list containing a list of each of the below:
                 1. The years over which the portfolio is held 
                 2. The cumulative value of the portfolio at the end of the given tax year
                 3. The interest earned
                 4. The tax paid 
                 5. The total amount of money invested 
             
        Assumptions:
            * The tax-free allowance for capital gains tax is £12500
            * The tax rate above the tax-free threshold is 40%
            * Capital gains tax: 
                We assume that we sell some fraction of our portfolio each year (and reinvest it in different shares). The amount of capital gains tax will 
                depend on the return on investment(ROI). This in turn will depend on the average age of the shares sold and the input IRR. We assume we sell 20% of our portfolio every year, selling oldest shares first. Under this assumption, for the first 5 years the age of the stocks sold is the number of years since the starting year, and after 5 years the age of any stocks will always be 5 years. E.g. if you have 5 shares, then at the end of each year:
                        Year 1      Year 2      Year 3      Year 4      Year 5      Year 6      Year 7       ...
